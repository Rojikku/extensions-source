# Pulls shared code/build-system/library changes from upstream keiyoushi
# (remote: kei), excluding extension source we don't want in our history
# (src/, lib-multisrc/).
#
# Does NOT commit anything automatically. It fetches kei and applies each
# changed file's diff independently, staging whatever applies cleanly (or
# with 3-way conflict markers) and leaving genuinely unresolvable files
# untouched, with their raw diff saved for manual merging. .kei-sync is
# only advanced automatically when every file applied; otherwise you
# advance it yourself once the leftovers are dealt with.
#
# The .kei-sync file (tracked in git) is the source of truth for "how far
# we've synced" so it survives clones/fresh machines. The kei-sync/kei-last
# tags are just a local convenience derived from it for `git log`/`git diff`.
#
# Usage: scripts/sync-kei.sh
