#                                     - conflicting applies fall back to a
#                                       3-way merge, leaving conflict
#                                       markers in the file and the path
#                                       staged as unmerged, for manual

#                                     - files that can't be applied at all
#                                       (including binary files that
#                                       diverged locally) are left
#                                       untouched, with the raw upstream

#                                   all, it's left unadvanced so the next

# Both modes also print, up front, every rename kei's history shows for this

# is 50%, which misses heavily-rewritten renames entirely, exactly the ones
# most likely to carry fork customizations someone needs to re-port) and
# every pure deletion (no matching replacement). For a rename whose old path
# has local changes, the fork's own edit to that old file (just our changes,
# not the whole file) is saved to
# .git/kei-sync-pending/<oldpath>.fork-customizations.diff -- a ready-made
# checklist of what to port into the new file, instead of having to
# reconstruct it from memory. --status additionally compares the CURRENT
# working tree (not just the pending range) against kei's tree to catch
# files we're still carrying that no longer exist upstream at all -- usually
# the old half of a rename that never got deleted.
#
# Both modes append a timestamped record (range, branch, per-file buckets)
# to .git/kei-sync.log, so "what commit did I last run this against" is
# always answerable without digging through branch names or reject-dir
# leftovers. The log is untracked/local-only, same as kei-sync-pending.
#
# A bad sync is always cheap to undo: everything happens on a throwaway
# branch, so abandoning it is just switching back and deleting that branch
# (see the message printed at the end -- do NOT `git reset --hard` to the
# kei-last/kei-sync tags, they point into kei's own disjoint history, not
# ours, and would blow away the whole tree).
#
# The .kei-sync file (tracked in git) is the source of truth for "how far
# we've synced" so it survives clones/fresh machines. The kei-sync/kei-last
# tags are just a local convenience derived from it for `git log`/`git diff`
# against kei's own commit graph.

Usage: scripts/sync-kei.sh [--status]

Pulls shared code/build-system/library changes from upstream keiyoushi
(remote: kei) into this fork, excluding extension source (src/,
lib-multisrc/) and anything listed in .kei-sync-ignore.

  (no args)   Apply mode. Applies each changed file's diff (clean apply,
              3-way conflict markers, or left untouched with a saved
              patch under .git/kei-sync-pending/ if it can't apply at
              all). Commits the .kei-sync bump automatically once every
              file at least applied. Creates a throwaway branch
              kei-sync-<sha>; nothing is pushed.

  --status    Read-only. Reports which pending files already match
              upstream, are untouched, or diverge from both, plus any files
              you're still carrying that no longer exist upstream at all.
              Safe to re-run any time; exits non-zero while anything's
              pending.

  -h, --help  Show this help.

Both modes print detected renames (10% similarity threshold -- catches
heavily-rewritten renames default git detection misses) and pure deletions
up front. For a rename with local changes on the old side, the fork's own
edit to that file is saved separately so it's obvious what needs porting
into the new file, instead of relying on memory.

Files:
  .kei-sync                  Tracked. Last-synced kei/main commit.
  .kei-sync-ignore            Tracked, optional. Paths permanently excluded
                              from sync, one per line, '#' comments allowed.
  .git/kei-sync-pending/      Untracked. Raw diffs (+stderr) for files that
                              couldn't be applied at all, plus
                              <path>.fork-customizations.diff for renames
                              with local changes. Regenerated each run.
  .git/kei-sync.log           Untracked. Timestamped record of every run.
  .git/kei-sync-decisions.jsonl
                              Untracked, optional. Written by the
                              kei-sync-vscode helper; read by --status to
                              annotate Diverged entries with your actual
                              resolution decision instead of guessing from
                              diff size.
